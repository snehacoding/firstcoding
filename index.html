<p> It is seen every year at the end of November month that the <a href= "https://www.aqi.in/dashboard/india/delhi/new-delhi"> AQI level of Delhi !</a> increaaes a lot. Which is very dangerous to breathe. Even one breathe os equal to almost inhaling 60 segrates at once. Which is not good for human health at all. Here we can see the AQI table which tells us whta quality of air is good for us to breathe. </p>

<p>But as pollution level increases during October and November only. Because this time a few causes helps it to increase.As it is festive season during this time. So movement of vehicles also increases.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:pink;">2.Crackers Pollution</h2>

<p>As it is festive season so people do burst cracker but that is not really a big cause to be considered. But it affects a little to the quality of Delhi's air for around 3 to 4 days. </p>

<p>But this time burning of cracker was more than as usual years it used to be. </p>

<h2 style="background-color:pink;">Parrali Pollution</h2>

<p>During these months only parrali are burnt in fields of farmers of state Haryana, UP. So, according to government that burnt pollution of parrali comes to Delhi. But according to news reports and AQI officers the pollution of burnt parrali is negligible. </p>
